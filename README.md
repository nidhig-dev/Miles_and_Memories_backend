- 🔑 Environment Variables (.env)

    - Create a .env file in the backend folder:

```
PORT=3000

```
🌱 Database Seeding

Preload the database with user and story data for testing.

🧾 Data files

Located in utilities/:

storiesData.mjs

userData.mjs

🌿 Seed script

utilities/seedScript.mjs handles database seeding.

▶️ Run the seed script

```bash
node utilities/seedScript.mjs
```
This will:

Connect to MongoDB

Clear existing users & stories

Insert new seed data

Automatically link stories with users

🚀 Running the Server

Start the backend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

(package.json must include "dev": "nodemon server.mjs" under scripts)
